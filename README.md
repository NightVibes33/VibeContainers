# VibeContainers

## NyxPhone integration

The built-in TrollStore app reuses VibeContainers' existing package browser,
IPA extractor, persistent per-app containers, signing, tweak preparation, and
guest launcher. The additive `nyxphone/` runtime integrates pinned Nyxian,
vphone-cli, and vphone-aio provenance without replacing the current
VibeContainers app or guest-control implementations. CI embeds a source-built
arm64 `NyxValidation.ipa` for install-path validation.

The TrollStore workspace is private to VibeContainers/NyxPhone. It does not
register apps with the physical device's Apple SpringBoard.

VibeContainers is an experimental iPhone and iPad host with an iOS-style shell and an embedded [LiveContainer](https://github.com/LiveContainer/LiveContainer) runtime for importing and running guest apps. It is not an emulator or a security boundary: guest apps run inside the host and may be able to access other guest data.

## Requirements

- macOS with Xcode 26 or newer and the iOS platform installed
- Git 2.13 or newer (for recursive submodules)
- An arm64 iPhone or iPad running iOS/iPadOS 17 or newer for installation and guest execution
- An Apple Developer account and a Development Team selected in Xcode for a signed device build

The project targets physical iOS devices. The unsigned command below checks compilation only; it does not produce an installable app. Simulator guest execution is not supported.

## Get the source

Clone with submodules:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/GenericCoding/VibeContainers.git
cd VibeContainers
```

If the repository is already cloned, initialize OpenSSL before opening Xcode:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
./scripts/prepare_dependencies.sh
```

`prepare_dependencies.sh` verifies that OpenSSL is pinned to commit
`623c84da314e85363236507ca38a4bde65df21c3`. If a prior local build altered the
XCFramework's outer signature metadata, the script restores that metadata from
the pinned commit and verifies the vendor signature. It changes no LiveContainer
source files, and the committed OpenSSL submodule pin is unchanged.

## Build and run in Xcode

1. Open `iOSSim.xcodeproj` in Xcode and select the shared `iOSSim` scheme.
2. In **Signing & Capabilities**, choose your own Development Team for the app and embedded targets that Xcode reports as requiring signing.
3. Replace the example bundle identifiers with a namespace controlled by your account. Keep the app-extension identifiers unique and preserve their parent/child relationship. Keep the `ContainerWidgetRunner` identifier identical to the value used by `ContainerWidgetStore.swift`, `ContainerWidgetHost.m`, and `GuestSigner.m`.
4. Select a connected arm64 iPhone or iPad running iOS/iPadOS 17 or newer, then choose **Product > Run**.

Do not commit personal Team IDs, signing identities, provisioning profiles, certificate files, or certificate passwords. Xcode creates provisioning profiles for the identifiers and team you select.

## Build with `xcodebuild`

After configuring your Development Team and bundle namespace in Xcode, build the signed Debug configuration for a generic device:

```sh
xcodebuild \
  -project iOSSim.xcodeproj \
  -scheme iOSSim \
  -configuration Debug \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates \
  build
```

To verify that Release sources compile without signing or provisioning:

```sh
xcodebuild \
  -project iOSSim.xcodeproj \
  -scheme iOSSim \
  -configuration Release \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO \
  CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO \
  CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY= \
  DEVELOPMENT_TEAM= \
  build
```

Build products are written to Xcode's Derived Data directory by default.

## Build an IPA with the script

The script selects a unique bundle namespace, prepares OpenSSL, creates signing
profiles when Xcode permits it, verifies the signed app, and packages an IPA:

```sh
./scripts/build_ipa.sh \
  --team-id YOUR_TEAM_ID \
  --developer-dir /Applications/Xcode.app \
  --output build/VibeContainers.ipa
```

Use `--device UDID` when Xcode must register a development device. Override the
default `com.team<team-id>.vibecontainers` namespace with `--bundle-id` when needed.
Run `./scripts/build_ipa.sh --help` for all options.

For a public unsigned artifact, omit all signing credentials:

```sh
./scripts/build_ipa.sh \
  --unsigned \
  --configuration Release \
  --output build/ViPhone-unsigned.ipa
```

An unsigned IPA cannot be installed as-is. Sign it with your own identity and
provisioning profile before installation. The unsigned build contains no `.p12`,
`.pfx`, certificate password, embedded provisioning profile, or code signature.

The host app does not need a PKCS#12 identity to start. JIT-less guest launch
does need a `.p12` or `.pfx` identity from the same Apple Developer team that
signed VibeContainers. You can include one local identity in a private build:

```sh
./scripts/build_ipa.sh \
  --team-id YOUR_TEAM_ID \
  --certificate /absolute/path/to/development-identity.p12 \
  --output build/VibeContainers-private.ipa
```

On the device, open **Settings > JIT & Containers > Use Bundled Certificate**
and enter the PKCS#12 password. The script never receives or stores that
password.

> [!WARNING]
> A bundled PKCS#12 file contains a private key and can be extracted from the
> IPA. Never commit the identity or publish an IPA that contains it. Public
> builds should omit `--certificate` and let each user import their own identity.

## Upstream components

The complete LiveContainer source used by VibeContainers is included directly
in this repository. OpenSSL is the only large dependency kept as a submodule,
pinned to a known commit so the main repository remains compact. See
`LiveContainer-3.8.0/README.md` for runtime-specific behavior and limitations.
